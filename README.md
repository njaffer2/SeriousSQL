Case studies for Serious SQL course by Danny Ma

### [Case study no. 1 - Health care analytics](https://github.com/njaffer2/SeriousSQL/blob/main/health_mini_case_study.md)
In case study no. 1, a set of business questions were posed related to a database from a user health-tracking app.
Some starter SQL code was provided, but it needed debugging in order to solve the questions.

Here's the scenario from the instructor, Danny Ma:
> We’ve just received an urgent request from the General Manager of Analytics at Health Co requesting our assistance with their analysis of the health.user_logs dataset.
> The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldn’t fix!
> We’ve been asked to quickly debug their SQL script and use the resulting query outputs to quickly answer a few questions that the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.

In the linked document, I have provided my debugged version of each query and the answers to the business questions posed, along with the buggy code for reference.

### Case study no. 2 - Marketing analytics
In progress!
